            Dark Souls III is an action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows.
            A part of the Souls series, the game was released in Japan in March 2016 and worldwide a month later. 
            Dark Souls III was critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. 
            It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies worldwide within the first two months after release. 
            A complete version containing the base game and both downloadable content expansions, titled Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades, was released in April 2017.
